# point-in-polygon
Script containing an algorithm to check if a point is within a bounding polygon, in 2D cartesian coordinates. It was completed as a piece of coursework for CEGEG082: GIS Principals at UCL. The coursework gave a small amount of extra credit if each line of the script was described, hence the fairly excessive level of commenting.

This point in polygon script is designed to be interactively run from the python interpreter window.
It can be used to load a polygon and points from a CSV file, or you can manually specify them yourself.
If you wish call the methods manually, execute the script and enter M at the first prompt.
